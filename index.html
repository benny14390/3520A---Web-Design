            <h2>Cascade Layers</h2>
            <p>An example of a newer feature of the CSS world is the new Cascading Layers feature. The cascade layers
                CSS feature allows us to define explicit contained layers of specificity, so that we have full control
                over which styles take priority in a project without relying on external sources for help. But what does
                this mean? You can establish your own origin and importance to yur code and start a hierachy of what you
                would like to see first in your layers and as you navigate through your website! </p>
            <p> Here is a visual example!!</p>

            <h2>Text Decoration</h2>
            <p>My favorite CSS feature that I have worked with so far would be the text decoration ability! This feature
                allows you to enhance the visual style and appearance of your text within your website. Some of the
                things you can accomplish with this feature are different styles of underlining and overlining text such
                as in different colors or different types of underlines like dotted or wavy!. You can add more thickness
                to your text beyond your basic bolding attribute to make your heading and in text highlights pop even
                more! </p>
            <p class="decorated-text underline-red">This text has a red underline.</p>
            <p class="decorated-text strikethrough-green">This text has a green strikethrough.</p>
            <p class="decorated-text dotted-purple">This text has a dotted purple underline.</p>

            <h2>The Future of Web Design</h2>
            <p>With the dawn of AI softwares at easy access to the general public over the last few years, we are about
                to see a revolution in the way website are created and coded, as well as the process of user experience
                (UX) that is so vital to the overall fucntionality of even your most basic website. AI has to ability to
                help with long and arduious tasks that coders face every day and help a project that should take many
                hours take much less then that. This can range from intense data analysis that can now be done in
                seconds to automating repetitive tasks that are featured multiple times throughout a large website. AI
                also helps website coders figure out many of the issues in their code with a simple search that can
                point out exactly what is wrong and what steps are needed to correct it. This is a process that used to
                take almost as long as writing the code itself, but now takes much less time thanks to new developments
                in AI technology like CHATGPT. I personally believe the benefits outweigh the cons when it comes to this
                brand new way of life in the web design world, and it can allow us to explore many unchartered
                territories many thought were impossibel 5-10 years ago!! </p>
